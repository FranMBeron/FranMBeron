**Software Engineer / Programmer**  
I love rebuilding systems and web applications from scratch.

I am currently starting to save Computer Science Notes that I write when I learn a new subject (you can check the CS-Fran-Notes repo, which is pinned).

Also exploring *Advanced Programming* with [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io).
