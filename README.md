**Software Engineer / Programmer**  
I love rebuilding systems and web applications from scratch.
Currently exploring *Advanced Programming* with [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io).
Also, starting to save Computer Science Notes that I write when I learn a new subject (You can check it in CS-Fran-Notes repo pinned)
